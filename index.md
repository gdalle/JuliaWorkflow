# What is this?

A series of blog posts on best practices for Julia development.
Consider this a draft: once the posts are ready, we will submit them to the [Julia language blog](https://julialang.org/blog/) to make them easily discoverable.

## Goals

Our purpose is to gather the hidden tips and tricks of Julia development, and make them easily accessible to beginners.
We do not cover the basics of syntax, and assume that the reader is familiar enough with Julia to read and write elementary scripts.
Instead, we focus on all the tools that can make the coding experience more pleasant and efficient.
For each of them, we provide a brief introduction, give a small actionable demo, and then refer to the appropriate online resources.
In the [divio documentation system](https://documentation.divio.com/), this would land halfway between a tutorial and a how-to guide.

## Structure

There are three blog posts of increasing technical difficulty:

1. Writing Julia code: setting up your development environment
2. Sharing Julia code: creating and distributing packages
3. Optimizing Julia code: improving time and memory efficiency

They are fairly long and not meant to be read in one sitting, so take your time.
Keep in mind that while each of these resources _can_ be useful to you, not every one of them _will_ be.
But at least you will know where to look in case you have a specific need.
