# Writing Julia code

<!-- \toc -->

## Installation

\tldr{Use [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup)}

```julia:version
#hideall
print(VERSION)
```

The official [downloads page](https://julialang.org/downloads/) is where you can get Julia's current stable release[^1].
At the time of writing, it is version \textoutput{version}.
But of course, new versions are released regularly, and you will need to keep up.
In addition, you may want to test your code on older versions to ensure compatibility.

Therefore, we recommend you manage Julia with a tool called [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup).
You can get it from the [Windows store](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup#windows), or install it from the [command line](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup#mac-and-linux) on Unix systems.
It provides [various utilities](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup#using-juliaup) to download, update, organize and switch between Julia versions.
As a bonus, you no longer have to specify the path to your Julia executable: juliaup takes care of that for you.

The defining feature of juliaup is that it provides adaptive shortcuts called "channels", which allow you to access specific Julia versions without giving their exact number.
You only need to know two of them:

* `release`, which is bound to the [current stable release](https://julialang.org/downloads/#current_stable_release);
* `lts`, which is bound to the [long-term support version](https://julialang.org/downloads/#long_term_support_release).

For instance, you can install the long-term support version with

```bash
juliaup add lts
```

When new versions are tagged, the binding of a given channel can change, and a new executable might need to be downloaded.
If you want to catch up with the latest developments, all it takes is to run

```bash
juliaup update
```

If you want an overview of the channels installed on your computer, just use

```bash
juliaup status
```

## REPL

\tldr{It has 4 modes: Julia, package (`]`), help (`?`) and shell (`;`).}

The Read-Eval-Print Loop (or REPL) is the standard way to interact with Julia.
Check out its [documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/) for details.
You can start one by typing `julia` into a terminal, or by clicking on the Julia application in your computer.
It will allow you to play around with arbitrary Julia code:

```>
a, b = 1, 2;
a + b
```

This is the standard, Julian mode of the REPL, but it also has three other modes which expand what can be done from within Julia.
Each mode is entered by typing a specific character after the `julia>` prompt, and can be exited by hitting backspace after the `julia>` prompt.

### Help mode (`?`)

By pressing `?` you can obtain information and metadata about Julia objects and unicode symbols.
For functions, types, and variables, the query fetches things such as documentation, type fields and supertypes, and in which file the object is defined.

```?
abs
```

For unicode symbols, the query will return how to type the symbol in the REPL, which is useful when you copy-paste a symbol in without knowing its name, and fetch information about the object the symbol is bound to, just as above.

```?
Ï€
```

### Package mode (`]`)

By pressing `]` you access the package manager.
This allows you to:

* `add`, `update` (or `up`) and `remove` (or `rm`) packages;
* `activate` different local, global or temporary environments;
* get the `status` (or `st`) of your current environment.

```]
activate --temp
add Example
status
```

### Shell mode (`;`)

By pressing `;` you enter a terminal, where you can execute any bash command you want.

```;
echo "hello";
ls ./pages
```
