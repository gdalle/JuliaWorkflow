We suggest you read the [Franklin documentation](https://franklinjl.org/) first to get familiar with the variant of Markdown syntax used here.

## Style guide

In the [divio](https://documentation.divio.com/) documentation system, our project lands halfway between a tutorial and a how-to guide.
Each section must be concise and focused on one topic.
Keep the language simple and the sentences short.

For each tool, we aim to provide:

1. a brief introduction with the relevant links
2. a small actionable demo presented as a code block

Every time a new resource is introduced, it should be put in bold face and accompanied with a link to the relevant GitHub repository or website, like so: **[Revise.jl](https://github.com/timholy/Revise.jl)**.
Links to the package documentation are not necessary, unless they are meant to highlight a specific part.

Package names are written as normal text with the .jl extension, while functions or objects are written between backticks.
Multi-line scripts are given as Julia code or REPL blocks following the Franklin specification.
